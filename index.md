# Chapter eight questions

## What is the difference between a government Bill and a private member&#39;s Bill?

A Bill is a proposed law. A Bill will become a law after it has been passed by both the upper and lower houses of parliament and assented to by the Crown. The main types of Bills are a government Bill and a private member&#39;s bill.

A **government Bill** is a Bill that has been approved by the Cabinet. These Bills are introduced either as a result of government policy or after recommendations put forward by government departments or other bodies, such as parliamentary committees, law reform commissions or interest groups in the community.

The majority of legislation introduced into parliament reflects the needs of the government departments. As the government represents the majority in the lower house, a Bill with Cabinet support will usually be passed by parliament. Government Bills include financial Bills, such as the budget, which provide for government spending.

Any member of parliament can introduce a Bill without Cabinet support. A Bill may be introduced by a member of the opposition or by a government backbencher. These Bills are known as **private members&#39; Bills.**

Private members&#39; Bills are usually unsuccessful. Generally, members of parliament are members of a political party and will vote according to their party&#39;s policies. Private members&#39; Bills that have been introduced by the opposition are usually defeated, as members of the party in government will often vote against the proposition.

## What is the role of the Parliamentary Counsel?

Drafting is a process of framing legislation in the form of a Bill. The Parliamentary Counsel is a public servant and lawyer who is responsible for drafting legislation.

The minister responsible for the introduction of a Bill, or the relevant government department, will brief the Parliamentary Counsel on the requirements of the Bill. The counsel will draft a Bill based on this advice.

## Explain the role of Cabinet in the legislative process.

At a Federal level, Cabinet consists of the Prime Minister and ministers. At a State level, Cabinet consists of the Premier and ministers. Cabinet plays an important role in the legislative process. The law-making policies of the government are decided at Cabinet meetings. Cabinet will also decide the order in which proposed changes in the law will be presented to parliament. It officially approves legislation to be introduced by the government.

Cabinet is not formally recognised by the Constitution. The role of Cabinet in the making of laws comes from parliamentary convention. Parliamentary conventions are unwritten rules about how parliament operates that have developed over time.

## How does the process used by parliament to make laws reflect the representative nature of parliament?

Parliament is an elected and representative body. The system is based on the idea that elected members represent the will of the majority of people, and therefore that the laws made by parliament reflect the will and the values of the majority of people. For instance, there has been growing concern in the community about family violence. Laws to implement the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Family Violence passed with bipartisan support.

## Explain four factors that affect the ability of parliament to make laws.

Certain parliaments have certain **restrictions** implemented on them. The jurisdiction of parliaments varies according to the division of powers, outlined in the constitution, meaning parliaments can only legislate within the specific areas of power given. For example, the commonwealth parliament can only legislate in areas of exclusive power and concurrent power, and the state parliaments can only legislate in areas of concurrent and residual power. Specific prohibitions exist, such as section 114, which reserves certain powers to the commonwealth only, such as the right to raise a military or navel service. Similarly, section 109 also establishes a restriction on state parliaments, by stating that in the case of inconsistency, the &quot;commonwealth will prevail&quot;, meaning that the states will therefore amend their legislation accordingly. The prohibitions and limitations outlined in the constitution can only be changed with a democratic referendum process.

Several kinds of **political pressure** may affect the ability of parliament to make laws. Political pressures can both inhibit and allow for parliament to be effective in law making. Domestic political pressures may exist within parties. Parties must be responsible and representative of the people, and their voters. However, certain groups or individuals in the community may add further pressure to the parliament, taking actions such as signing petitions and attending demonstrations as well as giving financial donations to the parties. There may be internal conflict within a political party, as some individuals may be reluctant to vote along party lines although that pressure exists. This could lead to a temporary crossing of the floor, or a conscious vote. A minority government may also feel pressure to implement their legislative program, and therefore water down their bills according, to the annoyance of voters.

The **role of the houses of parliament** also affect the ability of parliament to make laws. The bicameral structure of the parliament contributes to the representative nature of parliament as a lawmaker. The lower house represents the will of the majority of people. The upper house provides equal representation for each State or Territory (or region, in Victoria). In theory, this means that a range of interests is represented in the lawmaking process.

Most Bills are government Bills. These usually originate in the lower house. As government is formed by the political party with a majority of seats in the lower house, government Bills will be passed by the lower house. However, the government may not have a majority of seats in the upper house. The upper house can act as a check on the actions of the lower house. One of its essential roles is to review legislative proposals.

If the majority party in the lower house controls the upper house, the upper house may not act to review the legislative process. In this situation, the upper house may in effect become a &#39;rubber stamp&#39; â€“ a body that approves government Bills automatically.

Alternatively, if the government does not have sufficient support in the upper house, legislation may not be passed. The upper house may act to frustrate the legislative program of the government and block the passage of legislation.

Both houses of parliament are based on the principle of &quot; **representative** government&quot;. This means both the commonwealth, as well as the state parliaments, are elected by the people. The parliament is therefore answerable to the public and must make laws on their behalf in order to not jeopardise the chance of re-election. The parliament must vote on behalf of the majority of the community; however, this may be hard to assess. Regular elections are also held, to ensure that the parliament remains representative of the current people&#39;s opinion.

# Chapter nine questions

## What is the doctrine of precedent?

The doctrine of precedent is simply a system used by courts to make sure that similar cases are dealt with in similar ways, in the interests of consistency and fairness.

When a legal dispute arises, the courts are the place where it must be resolved. In order to make sure that each case is dealt with fairly and consistently, courts will look to see if any previous case has dealt with the same fact situation and will apply that precedent to ensure consistency.

The doctrine of precedent grew out of the courts&#39; role of adjudicating disputes, and their desire to be fair in doing so.

Law created by courts using the doctrine of precedent is referred to as &#39;common law&#39;, precedent or judge-made law

## Define the following terms:

### binding precedent

A binding precedent is a legal principle that must be followed. The doctrine of precedent depends on lower courts following the decisions of higher courts. The general rule is that a decision of a higher court in the same hierarchy is binding or must be followed by lower courts in the same hierarchy when deciding similar or &#39;like&#39; cases. For instance, in Victoria a judge of the County Court must follow the decisions of judges in the Supreme Court. A decision of the High Court is binding on all other Australian courts

### persuasive precedent

A persuasive precedent is a precedent that contains a &#39;convincing&#39; argument, but one that does not have to be followed because it is not binding: it is not a decision made by a higher court in the same court hierarchy in a case with similar facts.

### stare decisis

Stare decisis means &#39;to stand by what has been decided&#39;. Lower courts stand by, or follow, the decisions of the higher courts in &#39;like cases&#39;.

### obiter dictum

A comment made by a judge that is on a question of law, but not directly relevant to deciding the case, is an obiter dictum: a statement made &#39;by the way&#39;. A judge&#39;s statement or opinion in a judgment that is not part of the ratio decidendi may be used as a persuasive argument in later cases.

### ratio decidendi

Not everything said by a judge (or judges) while reaching a decision is a precedent. Only the ratio decidendi forms the legal principle to be used in future cases.

The term ratio decidendi means &#39;the reason for deciding&#39;. The ratio decidendi is the rule of law stated by the judge as the reason for deciding. According to the doctrine of precedent, in cases that have similar circumstances, the ratio decidendi of higher courts will be binding on all lower courts (in the same court hierarchy), when there are similar fact circumstances.

### overruling

A case may come before a higher court that relies on a legal principle that has been set in an earlier (and different) case decided in a lower court. The judge presiding in the higher court may believe that that other earlier case has been wrongly decided and the higher court would not follow the decision made by the lower court. When a higher court decides not to follow the decision of a lower court in a previous case, the higher court is overruling the earlier decision.

### reversing

Where a higher court hears a case on appeal and decides that the lower court which had heard the case had decided the case wrongly, it will reverse the decision. The ratio decidendi of the lower court is no longer valid. It is replaced by the ratio decidendi of the higher court. Examples of reversing are _Strong v Woolworths_ and _Fuller-Lyons v New South Wales_.

### distinguishing

Courts are bound only by the decisions of higher courts in similar cases. Where the facts of a case are sufficiently different from those in a previous case, the decision in the previous case will not be considered binding. Of course, no two cases are exactly the same. Provided a judge is satisfied that the facts of the new case are sufficiently different from the earlier one so that it would be unjust to apply the earlier precedent, then the precedent will be &#39;distinguished&#39;. This is an appropriate way to avoid using the earlier precedent. The judge may decide the new case by formulating a new precedent. This process allows for the continued development of the common law to meet new situations

### disapproving

Courts at the same level are not bound by each other&#39;s decisions. Where a judge in a court refuses to follow an earlier decision of another judge at the same level, that judge is said to have disapproved the other decision. In other words, they have demonstrated that their opinion of the law differs from that of the judge in the earlier case. This may result in an appeal to a higher court to determine what the law should be.

## Explain how the application of the doctrine of precedent can result in a change in the application of the law.

The operation of the doctrine of precedent is a feature of the common law system. Common law evolved from judges looking at previous cases to determine what the law should be. Each time a judge decides that an established rule applies to a new situation, the judge is using precedent. Other judges would apply the same legal principles in similar cases

## Define statutory interpretation.

The role of a court is to apply the law to resolve disputes. As well as applying common law to resolve a case, courts may also need to apply statutes, or Acts of Parliament. Judges must interpret the words of an Act when a case comes before the court in which the intention or the meaning of words used is disputed. This is called statutory interpretation. By doing this, judges are often involved in clarifying what is the law

## Outline reasons for an Act needing to be interpreted by a court.

There are several reasons why it is necessary for the courts to interpret a statute. One of the problems in drafting legislation is that legislation attempts to cover every situation that has happened (or that might arise). But Acts of Parliament often set out the law dealing with a specific area only in broad terms. The courts will need to interpret whether the broad terms set out in the Act include the specific circumstances in the case before them.

The intention of the Act is not clear. Parliament&#39;s intention may not be clear enough. Accurate instructions and direction may not have been given to the Parliamentary Counsel.

The Act is about a complex and technical topic. Parliamentary Counsel may not be familiar with specialist areas, such as areas of technology.

Difficulty in foreseeing possible future applications of the Act. It is difficult to consider all future applications of an Act. In our rapidly evolving society, it is almost impossible to predict changes in technology and science, or social and environmental conditions.

Inconsistencies within an Act or between Acts. Lengthy Acts, or Acts that have been amended several times, may cause problems in that there may be inconsistencies. Various provisions within an Act may vary slightly, as the same word may be used in more than one context within the Act, resulting in confusion.

Time pressures in drafting legislation. There may have been pressure to draft the Act in a hurry, resulting in clumsy, vague or ambiguous wording within the Act. Due to time pressures in drafting legislation, there may not have been enough communication between the instructing minister and the Parliamentary Counsel. There may have been little opportunity to check the legislation after drafting. This may result in loopholes.

Problems relating to defining words. The words used in an Act may attempt to cover a broad range of situations, but the courts must interpret whether a specific situation comes under this broad definition. Words may not be defined within the Act. Often Acts need to be interpreted to limit conflict between Acts within a State or between a State and the Commonwealth. Language is by its nature imprecise â€“ words may change meaning over time.

Words used may not cover recent changes. Legislation may have become outdated and need to be revised. The wording of an Act may not cover recent changes. For instance, a statute may refer to records and tape recordings but not specifically refer to other forms of recording technology, such as DVDs or the downloading of music from the internet.

## List the guides or rules that judges use to help them in determining the meaning or purpose of an Act of parliament.

There is legislation passed by both the Commonwealth and State parliaments specifically to guide courts. It sets out what other sources judges can use when interpreting legislation.

The _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ (Cth)states that Commonwealth Acts must be read or interpreted in accordance with the purpose or spirit of the legislation. Since 1981, all Acts of the Commonwealth parliament contain object clauses. These clauses are sections within the body of the Act setting out the general aims of the legislation.

Courts are permitted to refer to any reports prepared before the provisions were enacted. This includes reports by a Law Reform Commission, and treaties and international agreements referred to in the parliamentary process. Courts are required to consider explanatory materials when interpreting legislation.

The _Interpretation of Legislation Act 1984_ (Vic) states that courts are required to interpret legislation according to the purpose and intention of the statute. Courts may refer to the following materials in interpreting legislation: parliamentary debates; reports of parliamentary committees, royal commissions, law reform commissioners and commissions, boards of inquiry and other similar material.

The Act allows courts to refer to headings, schedules, marginal notes, footnotes, and other parts, divisions or subdivisions within the Act. Commonly used terms that regularly appear in most Acts of Parliament are explained or defined within the Interpretation of Legislation Act.

## Describe the relationship between parliament and the courts as law-making bodies.

In Australian society, there is a complex range of laws. These laws are necessary to protect the rights of individuals and to achieve social cohesion. The dynamic relationship between parliament and the courts in law-making is crucial to maintaining the effectiveness of these laws.

One feature of the relationship between the courts and parliamentis **parliament&#39;s supreme law-making authority**. It should be remembered that courts only exist because they were created by Acts of Parliament. For example, the High Court of Australia is provided for by the _Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900_ (UK),and the Victorian Supreme Court, founded in 1852, derives its authority from the Victorian Constitution. A court&#39;s authority, including its jurisdictional limit, has been set by parliament. Since parliament can make or unmake any of its own laws it follows that, other than the High Court, a parliament can both limit the authority of a court and abolish it. Parliament can pass a law to override the common law made by the courts. The courts can declare a law made by parliament ultra vires when it exceeds the law-making authority set out in the Constitution.

Another feature of the relationship between the courts and parliament is the **codification** of common law. Codification refers to the process where the parliament confirms the courts precedent, collecting and restating the law in the form of parliamentary legislation. The case&#39;s decision is subsequently reflected and replaced by the new legislation. The primary source of that area of law then becomes the relevant statute, and subsequently interpreted by the courts. For example, in the _Mabo 1993_ case, the _Native Title Act 1993_ codified the decision.

Another feature of the relationship between the courts and parliament is the **abrogation** of common law. Parliament holds the authority to abrogate common law, removing/abolishing court precedents and interpretation if they fail to match parliaments original intention, or if parliament disagrees with a decision made. In its place, parliament will create a new legislation to override the court. For example, in the _1979 Trigwell_ case, the high court followed a priorly established precedent (_Searle v Walbank 1947_) that farmers were not responsible for their livestock straying onto roads and causing injury. However, the parliament abrogated this decision by creating the _Wrongs (Animals Straying on Highways) Act 1984_.

Another feature of the relationship is the courts ability to **influence parliament**. The courts, when exercising their ability to make laws, can criticise the obsolete laws of parliament, as well as send a message to parliament instead of significantly changing the law themselves. Similarly, the courts can declare the legislation of parliament invalid on the grounds of it being &quot;ultra vires&quot; and acting outside a parliament&#39;s jurisdiction. For example, the High Court in their role can determine laws to be &quot;unconstitutional&quot;, and therefore declare a law void/invalid.

Another feature of the relationship between parliament and the courts in law making is the **interpretation of statutes by courts**. The courts may sometimes be required to interpret the exact meaning of words in a statute, such as when words are ambiguous or unclear in meaning, the statute fails to encompass new technologies, or a mistake was made in drafting. In any circumstance, the courts will clarify and make explicit new meanings with their interpretation. For example, the _Deign v Tarola 1993_ &quot;studded belt case&quot; sees the court interpret the parliament&#39;s _Control of Weapons Act 1990_ phrase &quot;regulated weapon&quot;, to see if Deign&#39;s studded belt was encompassed in the phrase.

## &#39;A number of factors limit the ability of courts to make laws.&#39; Discuss

The factors that affect the ability of the courts to make law can be said to relate to: the limitations of the doctrine of precedent, judicial conservatism, judicial activism, the costs and time involved in bringing a case to court, and the requirement for &#39;standing&#39;.

The **doctrine of precedent** refers to the notion of judges creating laws, called precedents. The doctrine of precedent operates under the overarching principle of stare deuces, to stand by what has previously been decided. This notion supports the whole idea of judges creating law and ensuring consistency and predictability in law making. Within a precedent is the ratio decidendi, which is the reasoning and logic behind a decision. This acts as binding precedent, which means that all lower courts in the same hierarchy are bound to follow the decision made. Precedents also consist of an obiter dictum, anything else a judge would like to say in relation to the case. The following acts as a persuasive precedent, which can be chosen to be followed by courts in a more superior position in the hierarchy, or in a different court hierarchy. Whilst precedents can be binding and ensure consistency, there is also a level of associated flexibly with judges having the option to avoid precedent through various methods.

Another factor is **judicial conservatism**.Judicial conservatism refers to an approach taken by judges to law making in which a judge takes a more cautious and conservative approach, showing restraint when determining the outcome of cases, reluctant to make significant changes to the law or consider external factors. Instead, a judge acts in a manner of strictly adhering to the principle of stare decisis, in order to ensure consistency, believing that law making is best left with the elected body of parliament. Therefore, judicial conservatism limits the amount of laws made by the courts, or the effects associated with the interpretation of states.

Another factor is **judicial activism**. Judicial activism refers to an approach to law making where the courts take a more active approach, fully exercising their secondary law-making power in order to create common law. Judges will consider a wide range of social, political and economic barriers associated with creating precedents. Judicial activism means that the courts believe and uphold their responsibility to fill in the gaps in the law, assisting parliament through developing precedents.

Another factor isthe **costs and time involved in bringing a case to court**. When taking a case to court, there are certain costs, as well as time delays, associated with trial. These may hinder individuals/litigants in pursuing a court case, while simultaneously serving as a positive means ensuring that individuals who pursue a case due so with a serious intention. Therefore, costs and time in bringing a case to court are a factor that affect the ability of the courts to make law. The costs associated with trial involve the cost of legal representation, jury costs of $550-1000 per day, filing fees, hearing fees and so forth. For example, an average case in the Supreme Court Trial Division can cost up to $60,000. The time delays associated with trial can involve pre-trial proceedings, court delays due to case backlogs, and the adjournment of certain cases due to the overbooking of courts. On average, 25% of cases heard in the Magistrate&#39;s court take longer than 6 months, which is a substantial amount of time.

Another factor is the **requirement for standing**. For the courts to make laws, the requirement for standing exists. &#39;Standing&#39; (locus standi) is the right of a party to start a legal action in a court. A party will have standing if they have what is considered sufficient connection to, and interest in, the court action. It is therefore not enough to simply be interested in changing the law, as the courts needs to see a direct negative connection before creating any precedent or interpreting a statute.

&#39;Standing&#39; is crucial in both common law and statute in Australia. The relevant statute law is the _Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977_ (Cth), and the common law relating to standing is found in decisions of the High Court of Australia.

# Chapter ten questions

## Explain why the law may need to change.

One reason for law reform is **changes in society and community attitudes**. Overtime, as society progresses, the law must be reformed in order to keep up with the current beliefs the community. For example, the _Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act 2017_ legalised same sex marriage in Australia, as the community&#39;s beliefs had changed, and the shift regarding the end of discrimination against LGBTQI+ individuals occurred.

Another reason for law reform is **changing expectations of the legal system**. Although initially, the legal system played an active role, simply dictating what individuals can or cannot do and controlling the conduct of society, the community now wishes for the law to take on a more active approach. The legal system is not only meant to ensure social cohesion by placing boundaries on behaviour, but in doing so also provides protections for the community. The law must be made &quot;in future&quot; to take preventative measures, ensuring the community doesn&#39;t suffer from harm. For example, the August 2016 expansion of the Koori Court, which involved the establishment of the County Koori Court for the sentencing of indigenous Australians, in a manner which protects their rights and recognises the systematic issues faced by this group of people.

Another reason for law reform is **changing community awareness.** As time goes by, people are becoming more aware of their legal rights and responsibilities. They are therefore more likely to question the law. Today we do not automatically comply with the law or accept the application of outmoded legal principles. Individuals now demand greater involvement in the processes of decision-making about the law and its institutions. It is inevitable that this will result in challenges to the law and changes to the law.

Another reason for law reform is **changing needs of government departments**. Government departments are responsible for the day-to-day administration of government policies. They have the power to make a range of important decisions that may affect the rights and responsibilities of individuals. These decisions include matters such as pension entitlements, taxation assessments and health benefits. Government departments can identify difficulties in the operation of the law and recommend changes to overcome the problems.

Another reason for law reform is **the changing nature of business.** Changes in the way we produce and sell goods have resulted in the need for more protection for consumers. Consumer rights are protected by consumer protection and trade practices legislation.

Another reason for law reform is **changing technology**. Technology has resulted in changes in the way business operates, and in communication and transportation. The law needs to change to meet the new demands created by new technologies. For example, the _Corrections Amendment (Remotely Piloted Aircraft and Helicopter Ban) Regulations 2018_ bans the flying of drones, a new advancement in technology, within 120 of a prison, due to the increased rise of contrabands smuggled in.

## List the methods individuals can use to influence changes to the law.

Individuals and groups can use **petitions** to influence parliament to change the law. A petition is a written request that parliament or the government act on an issue. In both the Commonwealth and State parliament a member of parliament may present a petition to parliament on behalf of the people in their electorate. During each sitting of parliament, the president or speaker will ask members to read out petitions.

A recent petition was the August 2016 petition to ban the single use of plastic bags in Victoria. The campaign group &quot;Plastic Bag Free Victoria&quot; presented a petition with over 11,000 signatures to the Legislative Council, and the reform was implemented in 2018.

Individuals or groups may also organise a **demonstration**. A demonstration is a large public gathering consisting of members of the community coming together to express their common concern or dissatisfaction with a specific area of law, in need of reform. This generates media coverage regarding the issue, allows for greater community awareness on the needs of legislative change, generates greater support and brings the attention of parliament on the matter, in the hopes of influencing change.

For example, on Australia day (January 26) in 2017, &quot;Invasion day&quot; protests were held in Melbourne &quot;fed square&quot;, protesting the holding of Australia day on a day of invasion for Indigenous Australians, which marks the loss of their land, culture and families. These demonstrations raise community awareness to the issue and call for parliament to take action.

Individuals can also make **use of the courts** as a means of influencing law reform. If any individual fulfils the requirement for standing, they can take a case to court, and if no existing legislation or binding precedent exists, and an unclear point of law is clarified or established, then the case leads to the courts playing a law making role, and the individual therefore influencing law reform. The courts can only influence a change in the law if a case comes directly before them, and only regarding the issue of the specific case.

One example of the use of the courts was when a group of lawyers from the &quot;Human Rights Law Centre&quot; in 2016-17, took their case to the Supreme Court of Victoria, acting on behalf of a group of youths that had been placed in Barwon Prison. The lawyers argued that the detainment of children in an adult prison was a breach of human rights and unlawful. The courts agreed with this and the lawyers were successful in influencing law reform. New legislation was implemented, with the children being relocated to a youth justice and remand centre, removing them from the prison.

## Comment on the effectiveness of each method you discussed in question 2.

**Petitions** are an _effective_ method of influencing law reform as they are inexpensive. Therefore, many individuals have access to this means of influencing law reform, since the resource is cheap to organise. _However_, petitions are quite passive and may not be able to generate as much media attention or implement the desired pressure on parliament to look at the petition and reform the law.

Petitions are also _effective_ as they can highlight the extent of public support for an issue, through a collection of many signatures. This allows for the formal, written request to be considered and attract the attention of a parliamentary member, who may table it into parliament. However, petitions are _ineffective_ as without a substantial number of signatures, it may not have the backing required to be considered and passed by parliament. Similarly, the influence of a petition will be highly dependent on which party tables it into parliament.

**Demonstrations** are an _effective_ means to influence law reform as they generate large amounts of media attention. The large gathering will often attract numerous media outlets, which allows for the greater publicising and ultimate social awareness regarding a specific issue. This encourages the public to get further involved in the issue. However, demonstrations can be _ineffective_ as they can often turn violent, and therefore generate negative media attention. This has a bad impact as it may make the community and parliament more reluctant in aligning themselves with supporting a certain issue, due to the bad media attention.

Demonstrations are also _effective_ as they can attract many participants, clearly highlighting the extent of public support for an issue and therefore attract the attention of a member of parliament, who may adopt the issue and table a bill into parliament, allowing for law reform. However, they can be _ineffective_ as demonstrations are often one-off events, and therefore may not create the ongoing amount of pressure for the parliament to respond through implementing law reform.

The **use of the courts** is _effective_ as judges are non-political entities, and therefore can influence law reform by acting impartially in their law making. Judges will look at the case facts objectively, without posing any bias that may deny a fair outcome. _However_, judicial officers are not elected, and therefore their decisions and comments may not be representative of the views and values of the community.

The use of the courts is also _effective_ as it allows the courts to challenge existing laws that are made outside of the parliament&#39;s jurisdiction, and therefore declare these laws &quot;ultra vires&quot;, making this invalid. This further clarifies the law, ensuring that parliament has not abused their power. _However_, the individuals may be reluctant to use the courts due to the high costs and time delays associated with taking a case to court. Success is also not guaranteed, and all these factors may make an individual reluctant to pursue a court case.

## Describe how the media can be used to influence changes to the law.

The media are often used to help influence a change in the law. People contact newspapers with their concerns, writing a letter to the editor. They may also participate in television or radio interviews and discussions.

A spokesperson for a pressure group may be interviewed for a television program, or their actions may be reported as part of regular news broadcasts. Alternatively, a pressure group can raise enough money to mount a media campaign of its own, running advertisements in newspapers and magazines or television, or arranging for material to be delivered by mail.

In recent years social media has emerged as a powerful tool to influence reforms in the law. Groups and individuals participate in blogs and discussion forums and can set up websites to promote discussion of issues. Social networking sites, such as Facebook, can also be used to gather support for a change in the law.

Sometimes the media itself acts as a pressure group to help bring about a change in the law. From time to time newspapers and current affairs radio and television programs conduct special investigations into issues of concern.

The 2016 Australian film, &quot;Chasing Asylum&quot;, was released on social media and raised awareness on the mistreatment of asylum seekers in Nauru detention centres. Many individuals acted on the issue by influencing parliament to change asylum seeker laws, writing to members of parliament, signing petitions and donating to refugee camps.

## Using a recent example, describe the role of the Victorian Law Reform Commission in influencing changes to the law.

The Victorian Law Reform Commission (VLRC) was established in 2001 by the _Victorian Law Reform Commission Act 2000_ (Vic). The VLRC is an independent, government-funded body responsible for developing, monitoring and coordinating law reform activity in Victoria.

The role of the VLRC is to examine, report and make recommendations to the Attorney-General on any proposal or matter relating to law reform in Victoria that is referred to the commission by the Attorney-General. They also examine, report and make recommendations to the Attorney-General on any matter which they believe raises relatively minor legal issues that are of general community concern. The VLRC also has a role in providing educational programs in relation to law reform and possible changes in the law. The investigation process can involve inviting public submissions, conducting community consultations, preparing research papers and interviewing experts.

In October 2014, the Attorney-General asked the Commission to report and review on the role of victims in the criminal trial process. In this review, the Commission considered what role the victim ought to play in trials and what changes to the law and court proceedings might better accommodate their rights, expectations and sensitivities.

In August 2015, after extensive research and preliminary consultations, the Commission published a consultation paper that described current law and practice, surveyed alternative approaches from other jurisdictions, and listed options for reform. It also posed questions to guide consultations and invited written public submissions.

The report, delivered on 1 September 2016 and tabled in Parliament on 22 November, made 51 recommendations.

## Evaluate the role of the Victorian Law Reform Commission in influencing changes to the law.

The Victorian Law Reform Commission&#39;s (VLRC) role in influencing changes to the law is _effective_ as they can investigate matters on their own accord and over 77% of their recommendations are implemented into legislation. This displays how much of an influence the VLRC has on law reform. They can also obtain community input through methods such as submissions, consultations and hearings in order to represent the people. _However_, the VLRC cannot act on their own accord in major law reforms and parliament is not under any obligation to uphold any of the recommendations which are put forward. The VLRC also has limited funding and resources and can be very costly as well as time consuming.

## Evaluate the role of either a royal commission or a parliamentary committee in influencing changes to the law. In your response you should refer to a recent example (within the last 4 years).

Royal commissions are inquiries appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the government. These inquiries are temporary and are made by a body appointed by the government to provide advice on or to investigate a particular issue. These inquiries are usually open to the public and seek input from the community. The reports of royal commissions are tabled in parliament. Royal commissions may be called by the Commonwealth government, the State government or both.

The Commonwealth government has the power to establish a royal commission under the _Royal Commissions Act 1902_ (Cth), and the Victorian government can establish a royal commission under the _Inquiries Act 2014_ (Vic).

A royal commission is established when the Governor-General or Governor issues &#39;Letters Patent&#39;. Letters Patent are issued under the Public Seal of State. The Letters Patent will state who will form part of the royal commission, who will chair the royal commission and the terms of reference. The terms of reference may also set the time by which the royal commission is to report.

Royal commissions have specific powers of investigation. They include wide-ranging coercive powers of investigation, such as the ability to summons and cross-examine witnesses, and to obtain evidence. Royal commissions can also apply for warrants to search and to seize evidence.

A royal commission has extensive powers to conduct hearings. These hearings are usually formal in nature and involve interviewing witnesses and taking evidence. A royal commission is not bound by the same rules of procedure and evidence as a courtroom.

One _example_ of an established royal commission was the &quot;Royal Commission into Family Violence&quot;, which was an inquiry body established from February 12th, 2015 to 2016. The Royal Commission was created with the purpose of investigating and making recommendations regarding the issue of family violence, and how support services provided by the state of Victoria could be better.

After 12 months of investigation, the Royal Commission conducted 44 community consultations, 25 public hearings with 13 witnesses, who were summoned using the royal commissions increased power, and a a total of 968 total public submissions were made to the commission. A final report was tabled in March 2016, containing 227 recommendations on improving family violence across Victoria, such as through increased support services and workplace training. The impact of these recommendations was significant and led to the introduction of the _Family Violence Reform Implementation Monitor Act 2016_ (Vic).

Royal commissions are _effective_ as they are the highest form of inquiry on matters of public importance and have unique and coercive powers of investigation, including the power to summon witnesses to give evidence under oath or to produce documents. However, they can be _ineffective_ as the government does not have to follow royal commission recommendations and there may also be a difficulty in finding lawyers who are prepared to leave or disrupt their practices for a prolonged period.

# Chapter eleven questions

## Describe four strengths and four weaknesses of parliament&#39;s role in responding to the need for law reform.

Parliament is an elected and representative body. It has the **resources and expertise** necessary for the drafting of legislation. Ministers may call on the specialist knowledge of members of their departments to advise on the content of proposed laws and on the need to change the law. Parliament can form committees, working parties and special bodies to assess the need for change and make recommendations for change. As parliament has access to expert information, it is able to keep up with changes in society and monitor the need for reform in the law.

However, there can be some **delays in law-making**. Although parliament can change the law at any time, in order to do that parliament must be meeting. These times are known as sittings. Parliament does not sit every day of the year. Generally, parliaments tend to sit 40â€“70 days a year. During non-sitting periods, members of parliament work on committees and/or in their electorates.

Parliament is **democratically elected**. This process aims to ensure that legislation reflects the will of the majority of people and the changing needs of society. Governments that ignore the community&#39;s wishes to change unpopular laws may suffer the consequences at election time.

However, although members of parliament are elected to represent the interests of the people in their electorate, most members of parliament are also members of a political party. Political parties can exercise strong discipline over their members of parliament. Members of parliament are expected to **vote according to their party&#39;s policy**.

Parliament is capable of undertaking **comprehensive law reform**. It may legislate to cover entire areas of public policy. It may establish moral obligations. Alternatively, legislation may act to support community attitudes, such as when the Victorian parliament acted to restrict smoking within 4 metres of school entrances.

However, the legislative process is dominated by the government, through the Cabinet, as it is Cabinet&#39;s legislative proposals that generally make up the majority of the parliament&#39;s law-making work. The government, through Cabinet, may be reluctant to propose legislation in relation to issues where there is no dominant community view, or where its own party policy is considered to be different from the dominant community view. These **political pressures** mean that some issues are not dealt with at all in parliament.

Parliament may authorise subordinate bodies to make what is called &#39; **delegated legislation**&#39; by passing an enabling Act. This aims to allow law-making to be more flexible and efficient. By delegating authority, parliament allows law-making to be directly responsive to local needs or specialist demands. For instance, local councils can make laws to meet specific needs in their local area. However, it often **fails to adequately supervise delegated legislation** , and has created a vast range of subordinate authorities that act with the authority of parliament. This lessens the extent to which parliament can be said to be the prime source of law.

## Describe four strengths and four weaknesses of the courts&#39; capacity to respond to the need for law reform.

The primary role of the courts is to settle disputes. In the process of resolving a dispute, courts can provide an **immediate response** to what the law should be in relation to a particular case. In applying the law day-to-day, the courts determine how the law is applied. This means that justice can be achieved in individual cases by interpreting the law as it relates to the facts of that case. Courts can distinguish, reverse or overrule decisions, and this can result in a change in precedent.

However, courts must **wait until a legal action is brought before them**. Even then, the law-making power of the courts is restricted by the nature of the dispute depending on whether there is any existing common law or legislation in the area. Therefore, the ability of the courts to respond to the need for changes to the law may be slow and spasmodic.

Through the application of precedent, courts provide considerable **flexibility** for the law to adapt to the changing needs of society. By distinguishing past cases or reversing or overruling past decisions, a court can change an established legal principle.

However, judge-made law cannot have the same wide-reaching effect as laws made by parliament because the decision in a case directly **affects only the parties to the case**. Though, the reason for the decision in a case can act as an important influence on people considering a similar action.

Courts are **not subject to political pressures**. They only need to consider the submissions put forward by counsel acting on behalf of the parties. Courts may consider the changed values in our society; however, there is far less pressure on them than on members of parliament to do so.

However, a decision by a court about what the law should be is not always reached quickly. Courts cannot reach a decision before they hear all the arguments put by both parties. In complex cases, this can take a **considerable amount of time**. A final determination as to what the law should be, may not be reached until after a case has been heard on appeal. This can take years.

The courts provide **consistent** application of precedent and interpretation of legislation. The application of the doctrine of precedent ensures that cases relating to similar legal issues are decided in a predictable manner. This is a fundamental aspect of **fairness**.

However, courts are **not representative of the community** as they are appointed and not elected. This means that members of the community do not know what the values and attitudes of judges are. Judges are independent of parliament and government and are not directly answerable to the electorate.
